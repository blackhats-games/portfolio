# Game Developer, Books Writer

## A little bit about me
Starting from the age of 12 ( I'm almost 17 now ), I got into the game development. I'm still fascinated how games actully are able to
dive a player into the atpmosphere, storyline and incredible gameplay. And then I understood that It's a business I'm fallen in love with.
