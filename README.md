# Game Developer, Book Author

## About me
I began exploring game development at the age of 12, and I am now almost 17. Over the years, I have developed a strong interest in how interactive experiences can combine atmosphere, narrative, and gameplay. This passion has motivated me to continue improving my skills and pursue game development as both a creative and professional path.  

What excites me the most is creating interactive stories where the player becomes the main character.  This interest also led me to writing books. I have been writing since the age of 13, but I completed my first serious book at 15. It took me over a year to finish "Games with time mechanics" and eventually publish it digitally.  

## Projects
***Pixel Blackjack  - Spring 2024 -***
[*Gamejolt Page*](https://gamejolt.com/games/pixel_blackjack/887560)

*Pixel Blackjack is a simplified version of the card game Blackjack, the essence of which is to collect cards in your hands, the sum of which will be close to 21, but not exceeding this number.*

This project revolves around a single mechanic, but my main goal was to create something I could actually release.  
Making a mini-game felt like a fun and practical way to bring the idea to life.
