## Game Developer, Book Author, 3D Artist 

## My Skills ðŸ§ 
I began exploring game development at the age of 12, and I am now almost 17. Over the years, I have developed a strong interest in how interactive experiences can combine atmosphere, narrative, and gameplay. This passion has motivated me to continue improving my skills and pursue game development as both a creative and professional path.  

What excites me the most is creating interactive stories where the player becomes the main character.  This interest also led me to writing books. I have been writing since the age of 13, but I completed my first serious book at 15. It took me over a year to finish "Games with time mechanics" and eventually publish it digitally.

Furthermore, I have skills in 3D modeling using Blender. I am experienced in creating characters, buildings, and small props. After releasing my book, I occasionally sculpt characters from the story in a Low Poly style. I am familiar with sculpting, texturing and combining my creative and technical skills.

## Game Projects ðŸŽ²
## ***Pixel Blackjack  - Spring 2024***
[*Gamejolt Page*](https://gamejolt.com/games/pixel_blackjack/887560)
[*Repository Page*](https://github.com/blackhats-games/Pixel-Blackjack)

*Pixel Blackjack is a simplified version of the card game Blackjack, the essence of which is to collect cards in your hands, the sum of which will be close to 21, but not exceeding this number.*

This project revolves around a single mechanic and a few scripts. 
Making a mini-game felt like a fun and practical way to bring the idea to life.

## ***Silent Caller  - Fall 2024***
[*Gamejolt Page*](https://gamejolt.com/games/silent_caller/942515)

*You play as Jeremy Stewart, who has been kidnapped on his way to a convenience store. Criminals keep him locked in a single room, where he receives constant phone calls. They trick him into believing there is hope and a chance to escape. Jeremy must solve puzzles and is forced into humiliating actions to earn this chance. But is there really a way out?*

The main goal of developing Silent Caller was my desire to create a project that would be simultaneously concise, engaging, and fully released.  
I wanted to prove to myself that I could bring an idea from concept to a finished product. This project helped me gain valuable experience in game design, storytelling, and polishing gameplay mechanics within a short format.

## ***Face on TV Chapter 1 (Demo)  - Summer 2025***
*Melissa Hawkins checks into the Flamingo Resort, a remote motel in the Wyoming wilderness. There, she encounters an eerie face broadcasting on a channel that doesn't even exist. Is it just a glitchâ€”or something far more sinister? On her way to uncover the truth, Melissa meets many people: some kind, others hostile, and some indifferent. Each of them has their own story to tell, and together their fates weave into a single thread that leads straight into real darkness...*
