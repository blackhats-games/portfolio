# Game Developer, Book Author

## About me
I began exploring game development at the age of 12, and I am now almost 17. Over the years, I have developed a strong interest in how interactive experiences can combine atmosphere, narrative, and gameplay. This passion has motivated me to continue improving my skills and pursue game development as both a creative and professional path.  

What excites me the most is creating interactive stories where the player becomes the main character.  This interest also led me to writing books. I have been writing since the age of 13, but I completed my first serious book at 15. It took me over a year to finish "Games with time mechanics" and eventually publish it digitally.
